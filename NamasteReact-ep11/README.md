# Higher Order Components

- A function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component.
- It takes a component as an argument and enhances it with some additional functionality and returns it.
- A component is a function that returns a piece of jsx.
- Let's learn it by developing a feature using higher order component.

# UI and Data Layer

An important part of a React application is to manage its data.
UI is very static and data is dynamic.
All the react applications have 2 layers:

1. UI Layer
2. Data Layer

UI layer(JSX) is powered by data layer.
Data layer consists of state, props.
Managing data layer makes our app super-fast, performant.

Lets learn how to manage data layer in React. DATA IS THE NEW OIL.

# React Context

- Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
